Clear tables makes it easier by abstracting OSM tags, using best practices, being open source, and building on standard tools\r\n\r\n### Abstracting OSM tags\r\nOpenStreetMap's free-form tag system where you don't need approval to map a new type of feature is one of its strengths, but it can make it hard for a data consumer. Instead of raw OSM tags where there can be multiple ways to tag the same object, ClearTables turns them into different PostgreSQL tables and columns.",
